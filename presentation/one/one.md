# The Application #

* Some guy is going nuts, he can not handle his company salaries and raises process.
* He contacts you and ask you to build a quite simple application

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# And you build it! #

* Awesome, the application works. Everyone is happy. That's it right?

# Day 1 - Injection #

* Early morning call from your customer.
* One employe automagically raised his own salary and was fired... so fix it.

#Did some research#

- You found that that a user used an Injection attack. He modified the query string adding and update statement.
- Query: javascript:alert(escape('1; UPDATE salaries SET amount = 123456789 WHERE user_id = 3;'))
- GET /raises/1
- GET /users/1%3B%20UPDATE%20salaries%20SET%20amount%20%3D%20123456789%20WHERE%20user_id%20%3D%203%3B

#The fix#

* Previously had:
 * @user = User.find(:all, :conditions => "id = #{params[:id]}").first
* Now he have:
 * @user = User.find(params[:id])
* We could also create a constraint for that route
 * get '/(:options)', :to => 'raises#index', :as => 'raises', :constraints => {:options => /\w{5}/}

#Sanitize input#

* Use whitelist validation, black lists are never complete
* Rails adds XSS protection by default in Rails3
* [SafeBuffers and Rails3.0](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/02/01/safebuffers-and-rails-3-0/)

#RoR built-in filter for special SQL characters#

* Default scape for â€™ , " , NULL character and line breaks
* Using Model.find(id) or Model.find_by_some thing(something)
* In SQL Fragments, specially in conditions fragments it has to be applied manually
  * (:conditions => "...")
  * connection.execute() 
  * Model.find_by_sql() methods

!SLIDE bullets incremental

* Prefer:
  * Model.find(:first, :conditions => ["login = ? AND password = ?", entered_user_name, entered_password])
  * Model.find(:first, :conditions => {:login => entered_user_name, :password => entered_password})
  * Automatically sanitize tainted variables

#Day 2 - Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)#

* Early morning call from your customer. Seems like somebody has been using his admin account.
* He lost control of the admin account.
